This app is written in Python 3 and depends on  Tkinter  (provided in the Python
standard library) and PyCrypto  (the only external dependency, available through
the pip package manager with `pip install pycrypto`).

    Included are all necessary scripts (sans the above), a README, and a project
report in TeX and PDF format.  Attached  along with this zip archive should be a
link to a video demonstration of the application working.

    Please see the project report for detailed information on the project.
